    <h2>{heading}</h2>
    <p><pre>This webapp is created by Abel Jacob Lim, from set 4O.

This webapp is a personalized message board. I intend to incorporate this message board into my own website, doubling as an artifact.

The message board will include:
    -3 separate "forums" accessible by the navigation bar.  One of the forums would be an "Announcements" forum
     (Actually, each of these "forums" would actually be 'topics' according to how most message boards work, ie. all of the posts on each of these "forums" would be in plain view upon clicking to enter each forum.)
    -registration of users, but very basic settings - with the ability to set an avatar, and the layout of the site (without even a separate "User settings" page, but instead these options would be immediately available on any given page)

The sitemap will include:
    -navigation bar between 3 different forums, and an about page
    -The "subject" fields of the 5 most recent posts (that would link to the actual forum posts)
    -announcements (which would display the beginning of the 2 most recently created announcements in a separately created Announcement forum)
    -number of registered users, list of users online

These are the intended usecases for this forum:
    1. Search for forum post (by user, or post content)
            -Sort forum posts by date, ascending or descending, and alphabetically
    2. Set layout of the current forum and its posts,  
            -selecting between 3 different layouts, via a drop-down menu that can select between layouts of the forum.
            -layout would be saved for a registered user. (In assignment 1, I would have a person considered logged in as a "Guest" by default.)
    3. Create/edit post on forum
            -has username and timestamp in addition to post
            -Could also post anonymously, or under any name, if not registered
    4. Register an account
            -Can set an avatar for the given account, but that's it.

About Assignment 1:
As of now, the layout designs have not been implemented. I focused on getting the coding done before
implementing the layout and incorporating images, CSS files, and scripts under the assets.
Assets for this webapp, such as images, and scripts, are not yet implemented, however; these are to
be incorporated by the next assignment.

What could be done better:
There are some redundant lines in the controllers, which I could resolve through creating a parent controller
as I continue working on this webapp.
As of now, I have not incorporated any new graphics.

This assignment was based off of our Lab 3, due to convenience. Unfortunately as of now, not much has yet been done
to customize the layout of this website, and so what I have is based on the Lab 3.
